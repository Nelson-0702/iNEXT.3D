#' Abundance Data for Function FunD
#'
#' This data set describes the abundance and functional distance of 168 woody plants
#' in Taiwan dynamics plots as reported by Wu et al. (2010).It includes two
#' dynamic plots: Fushan at northern Taiwan and Kenting at southern Taiwan,
#'  which contains 94,86 woody distinct plants respectively.

#' Incidence Data for Function FunD
#'
#' This data set describes the incidence frequencies and functional distance of 23 fungi at
#' Bavarian Forest National Park in German as reported by Simon Thorn et al. (2011). Data is
#' collected in two types of forest: logged and unlogged, which contains 16, 19 distinct
#' fungi respectively.
